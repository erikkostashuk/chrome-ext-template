A modern and robust Chrome extension template designed for rapid development using **Manifest V3**, **React 18**, **TypeScript 5**, and **Vite 5**. This template provides a solid foundation for building high-performance and scalable Chrome extensions.

## Features

*   **Manifest V3:** Built with the latest Manifest V3 specifications for enhanced security and performance.
*   **React 18:** Leverage the power of React for building dynamic and interactive user interfaces.
*   **TypeScript 5:** Enjoy type safety and improved developer experience with TypeScript.
*   **Vite 5:** Experience lightning-fast development with Vite's HMR and optimized builds.
*   **Hot Module Replacement (HMR):** Instant updates during development for a smooth workflow.
*   **Optimized Production Builds:** Ready for deployment to the Chrome Web Store with optimized bundles.
*   **Clear Project Structure:** Easy to understand and navigate project layout.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Node.js (v16 or higher) and npm installed on your system.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/chrome-ext-template.git
    cd chrome-ext-template
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## Local Development

### Running the Development Server

To start the development server with hot module replacement:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This command compiles your code and watches for changes, automatically rebuilding the `dist` directory. This setup is ideal for rapid iteration during development.

### Loading and Testing in Chrome

To load and test the extension in your Chrome browser during development:

1.  Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions`.
2.  Enable "Developer mode" by toggling the switch in the top right corner.
3.  Click on "Load unpacked" and select the `dist` directory from your project.
4.  The extension should now appear in your list of extensions. Any changes you make to the source code will be reflected automatically in the browser (you might need to refresh the extension in `chrome://extensions` for some changes).

## Building for Production

To create an optimized production build:

```bash
npm run build
```

The optimized and minified build will be output to the `dist` directory. This is the version you'll upload to the Chrome Web Store.

## Publishing to Chrome Web Store

1.  Ensure you have built the extension for production using `npm run build`.
2.  Zip the **contents** of the `dist` directory (not the `dist` folder itself). Make sure `manifest.json` is at the root of the zip file.
3.  Go to the [Chrome Web Store Developer Dashboard](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/devconsole/) and sign in.
4.  Click "Add new item" and upload your zipped extension file.
5.  Follow the submission steps, provide your listing details, screenshots, and promotional images.

## Project Structure

```
chrome-ext-template/
  ├─ public/           # Static assets (e.g., icons, images, manifest.json)
  ├─ src/              # Source TypeScript/React code
  │  ├─ components/    # Reusable React components
  │  ├─ hooks/         # Custom React hooks
  │  ├─ pages/         # Different UI pages (e.g., popup, options)
  │  ├─ utils/         # Utility functions
  │  ├─ index.tsx      # Main entry point for the popup (or other UI)
  │  └─ background.ts  # Background script (if needed)
  ├─ dist/             # Compiled extension (auto-generated by Vite)
  ├─ manifest.json     # Chrome extension manifest (v3) - moved to public/ in this template
  ├─ vite.config.ts    # Vite configuration
  ├─ tsconfig.json     # TypeScript configuration
  └─ package.json      # NPM dependencies & scripts
```

**Note:** In this template, `manifest.json` is typically placed in the `public/` directory so Vite can copy it directly to `dist/` during the build process.
